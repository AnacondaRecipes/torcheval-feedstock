  summary: |
    A library for providing a simple interface to create new metrics and an easy-to-use toolkit for metric
    computations and checkpointing.
  description: |
    A library with simple and straightforward tooling for model evaluations and a delightful user experience. At a high
    level TorchEval:
      * Contains a rich collection of high performance metric calculations out of the box. We utilize vectorization and
        GPU acceleration where possible via PyTorch.
      * Integrates seamlessly with distributed training and tools using torch.distributed
      * Is designed with extensibility in mind: you have the freedom to easily create your own metrics and leverage our toolkit.
      * Provides tools for profiling memory and compute requirements for PyTorch based models.
